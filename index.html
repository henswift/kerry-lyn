                <p>Most people, just like you and me, enter therapy because they want to feel relief or something to change.  The truth is, therapy is a place to go to have a different conversation about the stories that keep us stuck and disconnected.  I understand, we all find safety and security in our narrative, but it is essential we go beyond it if we are to establish more clarity and comfort in who we are and how we feel at our core.  It is from this place we re-connect with our capacity to change how we think, feel and relate.  It is then, and only then, we begin to experience ourselves, our partners, families, friends, colleagues and the world, differently.
